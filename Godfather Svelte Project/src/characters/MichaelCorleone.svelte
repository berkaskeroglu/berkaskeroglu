    photo: '/charpics/michael-corleone.jpg',
    birthdate: "March 23, 1920",
    occupation: "Head of the Corleone family and mafia boss, former U.S. Marine Captain",
    gender: "Male",
    family: "Vito Corleone (father), Carmela Corleone (mother), Santino Corleone (brother), Frederico Corleone (brother), Tom Hagen (adopted brother), Constanzia Corleone (sister)",
    spouse: "Apollonia Vitelli (1947-48; deceased), Kay Adams (1951-5; divorced)",
    children: "Anthony Corleone, Mary Corleone",
    bio: "Michael Corleone initially wants nothing to do with his family's criminal activities, preferring an Americanized life. Vito Corleone, his father, also hopes Michael will pursue a political career. Michael drops out of Dartmouth College to enlist in the Marine Corps after Pearl Harbor, serving bravely in World War II and receiving several honors before returning home.",
    bio2: "In 1945, following an assassination attempt on his father by drug lord Virgil Sollozzo, Michael reluctantly becomes involved in the Mafia. He kills Sollozzo and corrupt NYPD captain McCluskey, sparking a Mafia war. Michael then hides in Sicily, marries Apollonia Vitelli, but loses her to a car bomb intended for him.",
    bio3: "Returning to the U.S. in 1950, Michael takes over the Corleone family, planning to legitimize their operations. He orchestrates the elimination of rival Mafia leaders and consolidates power. Despite his promise to make the family legitimate, he faces family and legal challenges, including dealing with the fallout from his order to kill Fredo.",
    bio4: "In The Godfather Part II, set in 1958-1959, Michael's efforts to legitimize the family are complicated by an assassination attempt and internal betrayals. He uncovers Fredo’s betrayal, disowns him, and ultimately has him killed. Michael also faces challenges with the Vatican and business dealings, leading to further violence and personal loss.",
    bio5: "By The Godfather Part III, set in 1979-1980, Michael has moved to New York and continues his efforts to distance the family from crime. Despite his attempts at redemption and legitimacy, he is drawn back into violence. His son Anthony’s opera debut is marred by assassination attempts, including the murder of Michael’s daughter, Mary, which devastates him. Michael dies alone in the courtyard where he married Apollonia, reflecting on his tumultuous life.",
